🚀 Hi there! My name is Nex and I'm a programmer from Sweden 🇸🇪 with experience in Luau, JavaScript, and Python 💻. I'm always eager to learn and am currently diving into C# 🔥. In my free time, you can find me gaming on Roblox and The Forest 🎮. I'm a friendly and helpful person, so don't hesitate to reach out if you need any assistance or want to collaborate on a project.

I've been a ROBLOX developer for about 4 years now and have been playing the game since 2016. I'm always happy to answer any questions you may have, so feel free to reach out to me via Discord or Twitter.

In my programming sessions, I mainly use LUA in ROBLOX Studio and Visual Studio Code for the HTTP API. For design and graphics, I rely on Photopea and Blender.

If you're considering hiring me, know that I'm a hard-working and intelligent individual who is dedicated to creating high-quality work. My prices may vary depending on demand, but I promise to provide excellent service and a positive attitude.

I became a developer after creating games with friends and continuing to develop them with my cousin. I was inspired by other programmers and developers like TheDevKing, Alvin_Blox, and RoScripter, and my passion for programming only grew as I gained more knowledge. I now enjoy building and designing as well, and have had success with my own games and projects.

So if you need a hand or want to chat, don't hesitate to reach out!
