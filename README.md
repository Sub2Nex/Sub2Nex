# 💫 About Me:
Hello there! 👋✨<br><br>Many of you who visit my profile might know me as DecentAgent or simply Nex. I am a Developer with approximately five years of experience in Lua. My passion is focused on developing creative online tools and resources that serve the greater community, rather than solely my personal interests. But I obviously work on such too. 😼<br><br>Currently, I am quite distant from the general public, which means it might be a bit harder to get in touch with me than it used to be. I am genuinely focused on what interests me these days.<br><br>Thank you very much to all who support my work!
